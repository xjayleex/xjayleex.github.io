My name is Jaehyun Lee (Korean : 이재현). I am a grad student at Korea Aerospace Univ. and working at Bigdata & Distributed Computing Lab.
<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am interested in the high-performance computing systems for bigdata analysis and deel learning. For example... 
- <strong> Distributed Computing Frameworks (e.g. Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark) </strong>
- <strong> Parallel and Distributed File Systems (e.g. Lustre, Gluster FS, HDFS) </strong>
- <strong> I/O environment for High Performance Computing (e.g. Burst Buffer) </strong>
