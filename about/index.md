### Research Interests ###
I am interested in the high-performance computing systems for bigdata analysis and deep-learning. For example... 
- <strong> Distributed Computing Frameworks (e.g. Apache Hadoop and Spark) </strong>
- <strong> Parallel and Distributed File Systems (e.g. Lustre, Gluster FS, HDFS) </strong>
- <strong> Software Stack for High Performance Computing (e.g. Burst Buffer) </strong>
- <strong> Linux Kernel & Posix API </strong>
